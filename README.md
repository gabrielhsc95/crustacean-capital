# Crustacen Capital

Rust developer call themselves Rustacean, becuase of cRUSTacean. The unnofical mascot of the language is a crab. I want to create multi asset class analytics in Rust.

Therore, I asked Gemini to give me a funny name, and now I have **Crustacen Capital**.

## Background

I have been working in finance company for a while, and I want to practice Rust by implement stuff that I know. There is no IP in here. It is common knowledge. More than anything, I will follow 'Options, Futures, and Other Derivatives' by John C. Hull.

I am starting from calculating the present value of a fixed bond, because that is a relevant use case that if well done will be the base for many other instruments. Creating a Bond Pricer would be my PhD, because I would do in quantum computing. Rust is not quantum computing, but it is a great opportunity to learn the language.

I am not sure how far this will go, but I bet that I could publish a create about dates and calendars.

There isn't much as of now. Comeback soon.
